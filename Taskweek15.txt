Your task is to spawn multiple objects, each with different points.

For instance:

A Cone has 5 points
A Cube has 3 points
A Cylinder has 2 points
Then, interact with these objects, pick them up, and print out the accumulated points and number of pickups either as a log, on-screen debug, or create a UI if you have time.
